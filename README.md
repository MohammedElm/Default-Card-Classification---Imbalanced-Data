# Default-Card-Classification---Imbalanced-Data
In this project, we try to deal with the problem of Imbalanced data for the Default Credit problem. In particular, we try different approaches and models. We used methods such as : Class re-weighning, Over-sampling, Under-sampling, Ensemble methods. We made a comprehensive coparisons between different models (Log-reg, Random forest, XGboost, etc) using different metrics.

The notebook contains :

1- Importing, Pre-processing and Feature engineering


2- Data Exploratory 


3- Classification models and Improvements 


4- Evaluation and validation
